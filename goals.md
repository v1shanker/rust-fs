## Purpose

The primary goals of designing and implementing this filesystem are educational. Our goals, simply stated, are:
- Learn (more) about the Rust Programming language and designing software in Rust
- Learn about filesystem internals and optimizations
- Apply software engineering best-practices:
    - Thoroughly document design and implementation
    - Write code that is clean, readable, and elegant 
    - Decouple hardware and OS interfaces, to enable cross-platform functionality
    - Have complete testing coverage
- Develop at least one novel feature not commonly found in other filesystems

## Exported Inteface
